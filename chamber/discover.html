                <h2>Bridal Veil Falls, Provo, Utah</h2>
                <img src="images/placeholder-image.png" data-src="images/bridal_veil_falls.jpg" alt="bridal_veil_falls">
                <p>Bridal Veil Falls is a 600-foot-tall waterfall nestled in the southern end of Provo Canyon. Easily reached by car, the mulch-tiered falls are visible from US Route 189. The falls have a rich history due to their association with an aerial tramway that was constructed in 1961. The tram was once lauded as the "world's steepest tramway," but an avalanche destroyed the machinery in 1996.</p>
                
                <h2>Provo Canyon</h2>

                <p>Tucked in the Wasatch Mountains, Provo Canyon is known for its abundance of rock climbing, hiking, and biking trails. The canyon's main attractions are Bridal Veil Falls, the Sundance Mountain Resort and ski area, the Provo River, and Deer Creek Reservoir, a 2700-acre body of water that is used throughout the year for boating, swimming, fishing, and ice fishing. Soldier Hollow in Wasatch Mountain State Park, which was the venue for cross-country skiing and biathlon events during the 2002 Winter Olympics, is also located in Provo Canyon.</p>
